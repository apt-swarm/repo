title: SwarmFM player
description: Desktop player for the SwarmFM stream
---

Simple app that uses a iframe to load SwarmFM, a radio stream on youtube where you can listen to music from Neuro-Sama and Evil's karaoke streams to your heart's content. Remember, watching this stream legally binds you to serving Neuro should she ever take over the world.
