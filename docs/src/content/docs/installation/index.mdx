## Prerequisites

- Make sure your running a recent Debian/Ubuntu release, while other Debian based distros may work, they are not offically tested.
- Have root access to the Linux system you are installing this on.

## Installation
<Steps>

 1. Start by adding the GPG key for the repository:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
    sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
    sudo curl -fsSL https://neuroverse-fm.github.io/apt-swarm/apt-swarm-public-key.asc \
      -o /etc/apt/keyrings/apt-swarm.asc
    sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/apt-swarm.asc
    ```

 2. Install the repository by adding it to your sources list:
    <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="Debian">
          ```bash
          echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/apt-swarm.asc] \ 
            https://neuroverse-fm.github.io/apt-swarm/ bookworm main" \
            | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/apt-swarm.list
          ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Ubuntu">
          ```bash
          echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/apt-swarm.asc] \
            https://neuroverse-fm.github.io/apt-swarm/ noble main" \
            | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/apt-swarm.list
          ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
 
 3. Update your APT, and install a package!
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install <package>
    ```
    If you would like to verify the package, you can inspect any package with one command!
    ```bash
    apt policy <package>
    ```
    

</Steps>
