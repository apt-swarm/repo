title: Prereqs to getting a package in the repo

Meeting all the requirements listed below does not guarantee being placed into the repo, it just is a good starting point.
All packages must:

- Follow the license/copyright of the source code.
- Not be malware
- Must be connected to Vedal, Neuro, Evil, or the swarm in some way
- Work and run on a *clean* build of Debian and Ubuntu (it may need other packages, but they must be dependencies)
- Be a deb file

Further more, you need a Github account and understanding on how to submit a Pull Request, you can find more about that on the [Githubs docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
