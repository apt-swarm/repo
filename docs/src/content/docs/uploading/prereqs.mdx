title: Prereqs to getting a package in the repo

Meeting all the requirements listed below does not guarantee being placed into the repo, it just is a good starting point.
All packages must:

- Follow the license/copyright of the source code. (Your components must be at least source-available as well for verification)
- Not be malware.
- Must be connected to Vedal, Neuro, Evil, or the Swarm in some way.
- Work and run on a _clean_ build of Debian and Ubuntu (it may need other packages, but they must be dependencies)
- Be a `.deb` file.

Furthermore, you need a GitHub account and understanding on how to submit a Pull Request, you can find more about that on the [GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Lastly, while this is not a hard requirement, you should set up GitHub Actions so we can verify that the file matches your source code, as well as your build steps.
You can optionally choose to go one step further and establish provenance on your built artifact, but this is somewhat advanced and is not expected in all submissions.
