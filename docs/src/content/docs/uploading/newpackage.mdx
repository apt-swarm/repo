This is for new package, updates are on the next page!

<Steps>
    1. Make sure your package meets all prerequisites on the [previous page](/apt-swarm/uploading/prereqs).
    2. Build your package with correct metadata, it should have a name, icon, and author at the very least.
    3. [Create a fork of the repo](https://github.com/neuroverse-fm/apt-swarm/fork), and place your ``.deb`` file in the /debs folder
        <FileTree>
        - .github
        - **debs**
            - example.deb *This could be your package!!!*
        - docs
            - astro.config.mjs
            - ...
        - .gitignore
        - PROCEDURES.md
        - README.md
        - apt-swarm-public-key.asc
        </FileTree>
    4. Make a PR with this tool: [PR Creator](/apt-swarm/pr-maker). Please make sure you hit the "New package template" button.
    5. Fill in our template, and wait for either questions or approval of your app!
